# Python - Almost a Circle

Welcome to the "Python - Almost a Circle" project! This project is a part of the ALX Software Engineering curriculum and aims to help you practice object-oriented programming concepts in Python.

## Project Description

In this project, we will be working on building a Python package that consists of classes to represent geometric shapes, specifically rectangles and squares. The goal is to create a set of classes that will allow us to manage these shapes, calculate their areas, display them visually, and update their attributes.

## Structure of the Project

The project is organized into the following modules:

- **models/base.py**: This module contains the `Base` class, which serves as the base class for other classes in the project. It manages the id attribute for instances.

- **models/rectangle.py**: This module defines the `Rectangle` class, which inherits from the `Base` class. It represents a rectangle and includes methods to calculate its area and display it visually.

- **models/square.py**: This module defines the `Square` class, which inherits from the `Rectangle` class. It represents a special case of a rectangle where the width and height are the same. It also includes methods to manage its size.

- **6-main.py**: This is an example script that demonstrates the usage of the classes defined in the project. It showcases how to create instances, calculate areas, display shapes, and update attributes.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. You can explore and run the example scripts, such as `6-main.py`, to see the classes in action.

Feel free to modify and extend the project as you learn more about Python and object-oriented programming!
