# Python - More Data Structures: Set, Dictionary

## Overview

In Python, `set` and `dictionary` are powerful data structures that offer unique functionalities and characteristics. They are used to handle collections of data efficiently and conveniently. This README provides a brief overview of these two data structures.

## Set

A `set` is an unordered collection of unique elements. It is defined using curly braces `{}` or the `set()` constructor. Sets are commonly used for removing duplicates from a list, performing set operations (union, intersection, difference), and checking for membership in constant time. Since sets contain unique elements, duplicate values are automatically removed.

## Dictionary

A `dictionary` is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It is defined using curly braces `{}` with key-value pairs separated by colons. Dictionaries are commonly used for fast lookups and retrieval of data using unique keys. Each key in a dictionary must be unique, and the values can be of any data type.


## Conclusion

Sets and dictionaries are valuable additions to Python's data structures, offering versatility and efficiency in handling data collections. Understanding these data structures allows you to manipulate data more effectively and elegantly in Python.
