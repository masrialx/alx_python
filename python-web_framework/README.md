# Flask Framework


Welcome to the simple README for Flask, a micro web framework for Python! This document will provide you with a quick overview of Flask and how to get started using it.

## What is Flask?

Flask is a lightweight and flexible web framework for building web applications in Python. It's designed to be simple and easy to use, making it a great choice for beginners and experienced developers alike. With Flask, you can quickly create web applications that handle routes, templates, and more.

## Getting Started

To start using Flask, you'll need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Flask:**
   You can install Flask using a package manager like `pip`. Open your terminal or command prompt and enter the following command:
   ```
   pip install Flask
   ```

2. **Create a Flask App:**
   Create a new directory for your Flask project. Inside that directory, create a Python file (e.g., `app.py`). This file will contain your Flask application code.

3. **Write Your First Flask App:**
   Open the `app.py` file and import Flask:
   ```python
   from flask import Flask

   app = Flask(__name__)

   @app.route('/')
   def hello_world():
       return 'Hello, Flask!'
   ```

4. **Run Your App:**
   In your terminal, navigate to the project directory containing `app.py`. Run the following command to start the development server:
   ```
   flask run
   ```

5. **Access Your App:**
   Open your web browser and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. You should see the message "Hello, Flask!" displayed on the page.

## Key Concepts

- **Routes:** In Flask, routes define the URLs that your application responds to. They are created using the `@app.route()` decorator.

- **Templates:** Flask uses Jinja2 templates to render dynamic HTML pages. You can use these templates to generate HTML with variables and control structures.

- **Views:** Views are functions that handle requests and return responses. They are associated with specific routes.

- **Static Files:** Flask can serve static files like CSS, JavaScript, and images. Create a folder named `static` in your project directory to store these files.
