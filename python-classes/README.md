# Python - Classes and Objects

This repository contains Python code examples and explanations related to classes and objects in Python.

## Introduction

In Python, classes and objects are fundamental concepts of object-oriented programming (OOP). OOP allows us to create reusable and structured code by organizing data and behavior into classes. Objects are instances of these classes, and they encapsulate data and methods to work with that data.

## Contents

The repository includes the following files:

1. `1-square.py`: Demonstrates creating a simple class `Square` with a private instance attribute `size` and instantiation with an optional size argument. It also showcases error handling using exception handling for invalid inputs.

2. `2-square.py`: Extends the `Square` class with a public instance method `area` that calculates the area of the square.

3. `3-square.py`: Implements getter and setter methods for the private attribute `size` in the `Square` class. The getter allows retrieving the size, and the setter enforces validation for the size.

4. `4-square.py`: Adds a public instance method `my_print` to the `Square` class that prints the square using the "#" character. If the size is 0, it prints an empty line.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.

2. Run the individual Python files using the Python interpreter.

```bash
python 1-square.py
python 2-square.py
python 3-square.py
python 4-square.py
```

Feel free to explore the code and experiment with the different examples.
