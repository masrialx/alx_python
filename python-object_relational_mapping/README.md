Introduction
Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) is a programming technique that allows developers to interact with relational databases using programming language objects instead of writing raw SQL queries. In Python, ORM libraries provide a convenient way to map Python classes to database tables and simplify the process of querying, inserting, updating, and deleting data from databases.

This README will provide an overview of ORM, its benefits, and introduce you to popular ORM libraries in Python.

What is Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)?
ORM bridges the gap between object-oriented programming languages and relational databases. It allows you to work with database entities as if they were regular Python objects. With ORM, you can define classes that correspond to database tables, and instances of these classes represent rows in those tables.

ORM libraries handle the translation of object-oriented operations into SQL queries, making it easier to perform database operations without writing raw SQL.

Benefits of ORM
Abstraction: ORM abstracts the complexities of SQL, providing a more intuitive and high-level API for interacting with databases.
Code Reusability: ORM promotes code reusability by allowing you to define and reuse models across different parts of your application.
Security: ORM libraries often include built-in protection against SQL injection attacks.
Database Agnostic: ORM enables you to switch between different database systems without changing your application's code significantly.
Productivity: ORM reduces the amount of boilerplate code needed for database interactions, resulting in faster development.
Maintainability: The separation between code and SQL queries makes code maintenance and debugging easier.
Popular Python ORM Libraries
SQLAlchemy: A widely-used and powerful ORM that offers a high degree of customization and flexibility. It supports multiple database backends.
Django ORM: Part of the Django web framework, this ORM is tightly integrated with Django and provides a simple and consistent API for database interactions.
Peewee: A lightweight and expressive ORM that supports various database backends. It's known for its simplicity and ease of use.
Tortoise-ORM: An async ORM inspired by Django's ORM, designed for use with asynchronous Python frameworks like FastAPI.
